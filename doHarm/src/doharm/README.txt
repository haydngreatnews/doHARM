Just made a basic interface so we can get started. Feel free to replace anything inside your own component package(s).

We have decided to go with a different approach for the movement and camera - the camera will not move when you rotate, only when you 
press keys as yeah it may get annoying / dizzy.

Also movement will not be restricted to a grid and the player will be able to rotate in a full 360 degrees, but the camera will only be
only able to face 4 directions.






Note: this is marked on the use of design patterns. Try put these in if you can:

COMPOSITE
VISITOR
FACADE
FLYWEIGHT
OBSERVER
STRATEGY
NULL OBJECT
STATE
DECORATOR
ADAPTER
