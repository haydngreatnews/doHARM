	 * Composite pattern - Hierarchy of entities that have different versions of the same method
	 * 
	 * Visitor pattern - Items that use an entity to perform an action.
	 * 		-Character has useItem(Item item); then item will have a method
	 * 
	 * Facade pattern - Game is the facade.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Flyweight - use a singleton rather than many duplicate objects - Tile
	 * identify objects which are
		essentially identical (or refactor program
		to expose them); then, provide static
		factory methods for creating them which
		ensures only one instance for each
		distinct example.

		State pattern - AIState, use a seperate class for each state, combination of strategy pattern.
